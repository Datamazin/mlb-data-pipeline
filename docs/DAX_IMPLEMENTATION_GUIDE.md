# Power BI DAX Measures - Implementation Guide

## üìÅ Files Created
- `power_bi_dax_measures.dax` - Core boxscore summary measures
- `power_bi_advanced_dax.dax` - Advanced analytics and comparative measures

## üöÄ Quick Implementation Steps

### 1. Import DAX Measures into Power BI
1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Go to **Modeling** ‚Üí **New Measure**
3. Copy and paste measures from the DAX files
4. Create measures one by one or use **External Tools** to import bulk

### 2. Required Table Structure
Ensure your Power BI model has these tables with proper relationships:

```
FACT_BOXSCORE (Many)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game_id (FK)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_id (FK)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team_id (FK)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ at_bats, runs, hits, rbi, walks, strikeouts

DIM_TEAMS (One)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team_id (PK)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team_name, abbreviation, league, division

DIM_PLAYERS (One)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_id (PK)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player_name, position

DIM_GAMES (One)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game_id (PK)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game_date, home_team_id, away_team_id

DIM_DATE (One)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ date_key (PK)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ full_date, year, month, quarter
```

## üìä Key DAX Measures Explained

### Core Statistics
- **Total At Bats** - `SUM(FACT_BOXSCORE[at_bats])`
- **Total Hits** - `SUM(FACT_BOXSCORE[hits])`
- **Batting Average** - `DIVIDE(SUM(hits), SUM(at_bats))`
- **On Base Percentage** - `DIVIDE(hits + walks, at_bats + walks)`

### Advanced Metrics
- **OPS** - On-base Plus Slugging percentage
- **Clutch Performance** - RBI efficiency rating
- **Player Value Score** - Composite performance metric
- **Team Chemistry Index** - Team collaboration effectiveness

### Trend Analysis
- **Rolling 10 Game BA** - Recent performance trend
- **Monthly Trend** - Performance direction indicator
- **Hot Streak Detection** - Current performance state

### Comparative Analysis
- **Team vs League** - Performance compared to league average
- **Home vs Away** - Location-based performance differential
- **Player Ranking** - Position among all players

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Player Performance Dashboard
```dax
-- Use these measures together:
[Batting Average]
[Total Hits] 
[Player Games Played]
[Performance Indicator]
[Current Streak]
```

### Team Analysis Report
```dax
-- Team comparison measures:
[Team Batting Average]
[Team Total Runs]
[Team Runs Rank]
[Team Strength]
[Offensive Efficiency]
```

### Executive Summary View
```dax
-- High-level overview:
[Executive Summary]
[Boxscore Summary] 
[Team Performance vs League]
```

## üîß Customization Tips

### 1. Adjust Thresholds
Modify performance categories in measures like:
```dax
Player Category = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        BattingAvg >= 0.300 AND TotalHits >= 150, "‚≠ê All-Star",
        -- Adjust these thresholds based on your league standards
        BattingAvg >= 0.275 AND TotalHits >= 100, "üåü Above Average",
        -- ...
    )
```

### 2. Add Team Colors
Extend conditional formatting:
```dax
Team Color = 
    SWITCH(
        SELECTEDVALUE(DIM_TEAMS[team_name]),
        "New York Yankees", "#132448",
        "Boston Red Sox", "#BD3039", 
        -- Add your team colors
        "#808080"  -- Default gray
    )
```

### 3. Custom Time Periods
Modify rolling averages:
```dax
-- Change from 10 to 7 games for weekly rolling average
Rolling 7 Game BA = 
    VAR Last7Games = TOPN(7, ...)
```

## üìà Visualization Recommendations

### 1. Player Performance Card
- **Batting Average** (large number)
- **Performance Indicator** (status)
- **Total Hits** / **Total RBI** (supporting metrics)

### 2. Team Comparison Matrix
- Teams on rows
- **Team Batting Average**, **Team Total Runs**, **Team Strength** on columns
- Use **BA Color** for conditional formatting

### 3. Trend Line Chart
- Date on X-axis
- **Monthly Trend** or **Rolling 10 Game BA** on Y-axis
- **Current Streak** as tooltip

### 4. Executive Summary Table
- Single card visual with **Executive Summary** measure
- Use **Boxscore Summary** for detailed statistics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Use **SELECTEDVALUE()** when filtering to single players/teams
- Consider using **CALCULATE()** with proper filter context
- Test measures with large datasets for performance

### Data Quality Requirements
- Ensure no NULL values in key fields (at_bats, hits, etc.)
- Validate date relationships are properly configured
- Check that team_id relationships are correctly established

### Measure Dependencies
Some advanced measures depend on basic measures:
- **OPS** requires **On Base Percentage** and **Slugging Percentage Estimate**
- **Team Performance vs League** uses multiple team-level measures
- **Player Value Score** combines several component metrics

## üîÑ Refresh and Maintenance

### Regular Updates Needed
1. **Milestone thresholds** - Adjust based on season progress
2. **League averages** - Recalculate as season progresses  
3. **Performance categories** - Update based on current league standards
4. **Team rankings** - Refresh as standings change

### Seasonal Adjustments
- Modify **Season Hit Projection** based on actual games remaining
- Update **Games to Next Milestone** calculations
- Adjust **Hot/Cold Streak** sensitivity based on sample size
